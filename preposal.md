# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I have two ideas for now. I'm thinking of making something with a discord bot that tracks the kills an individual has in game and uploads it as a scoreboard. The score board will display whenever prompted in order to create competition amongst friends. Second idea is to use my graphic designing skills to somehow make something. I make 3d models of chains, textures, clothing for the game GTA RP.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
