# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I like doing 3d designing for a game I play called Fivem (GTA RP). I make 3d models of chains, clothing, textures, weapon skins, and more. 

Idea 1. 
  make a website where people can view my designs to purchase for their own in-game usage. (Not real purchasing, just for the project)

Idea 2. 
  Also falls under the 3d design...  make a website that has someone answer some questions about a design they want to be made. I receive the answer in their email. The email is for me to send them the design that they want    made in a few days when it is done. (designs take anywhere from 6 hours to 3 days)
  
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan on working alone

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I do not have any questions
