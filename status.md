#### Project title

3D modeling For You

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have made a few pendants as well as a chain model. One of the pendants I went ahead and put onto a chain to see how it would look.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Made the program that allows the user to choose between certain options. Also have not added any color to the pendants.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Making 3d models takes forever. Each pendant took about 3 hours and the chain took about an hour and a half. When combining the two to make a model, it took me about another hour and a half.
