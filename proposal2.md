# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
3D modeling for you

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that lets the user say what they want. Output will be a custom 3d modeled chain or weapon skin for GTA.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The beginning will ask the user what they are looking for, whether that being a chain or a weapon skin. If the user answers chain, they will get to choose between a single, double, or triple layered cuban link chain. They would they be asked what wording they would like. If they chose a double or triple layered, they would be asked to choose from a select amount of pendants. Finally, they would be asked what kind of colors they want the chain to be, but it can only be two colors. If they were to choose weapon skin, they would be able to pick ak47, Glock 22, or Glock 17. They would be asked what color they want the gun to be. If they want the full gun colored or just the slide and the handle. Also, they'd be asked if they want wording on the handle of the gun. Finally the website will take the answers and output what the final product would look like. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not doing so

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Alone

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The outcome of my project will have 3d models that someone can choose from. Regardless if there is nothing on the website that they wanted specifically, there going to be able to choose from whatever is already made.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The better outcome would be narrowing down some specifics and pointing out some of the things they listed if I cannot do all. 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Im hoping to accomplish a program that lets someone input a design that they want and the outcome will be a model of it.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

In this project I will learn how to make a website. I've never made a website which will be a new feature to learn. I will have to make some 3d models before hand, then put in some code that lets a user point out some specifics, the code will lean to one of the models I already made. With a final outcome of a model that they hopefully asked for. I will have to research how to make a website and input my designing in as well.
