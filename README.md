I had a great time making this project. I had some trouble making the chains because they all take so long to make. As well as the pendants. But for sure the coding of the website had me stuck for some time. I sought some extra help from my neighbor who is one of the owners of venmo. He sat down with me one night and talked me through the building of a website and it made everything come togethger. After seeking the extra help, the project all came together.
